<p>Swift was originally released in 2014, and Open Sourced by Apple in late 2015. The Open Source release generated an explosion of community interest and support, resulting in ports to other platforms and significant language changes. Swift version 3, which reflects the results of much of this work, was released in September of 2016, bringing with it some significant refinements to the core language and a new package manager.</p>

<p>Swift is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming styles. The language is strongly typed but has extensive support for type inference and substantial tooling available in XCode to identify and in some cases automatically fix common programming errors. Swift uses a memory management strategy called automatic reference counting (ARC), freeing programmers from the tedium of manually managing memory allocation. This combination of strong typing, maximal type inference, automatic reference counting (ARC), and excellent tooling results in an experience that can be described as "the Macintosh of programming languages".</p>

<p>This talk will present some of the history of the development of Swift with emphasis on how the Open Source release of the language kick-started activity, review the basic syntax of Swift (with comparisons to similar languages that attendees may be more familiar with), and describe what tools are available to help learn the language, including XCode, the Swift REPL available from XCode, and the new Swift Playgrounds for iPad that debuted with Swift 3 and iOS10. After attending this talk, an attendee with no previous Swift experience will understand exactly why they should be excited about this relatively new programming language and be up to date on exactly what they need to do to dive into Swift coding for themselves.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when writing a test, you don't have to opportunity to do dependency injection of the type of transport used in a specific API. Sometimes that code will unequivocally always use actual HTTP and the only control you have is over the host and port to which it will connect.</p>

<p>This talk covers a mechanism to work around that limitation and still write a readable, maintainable test.</p>

<p>Modern programming languages have a wide spectrum of error handling methods and related cultural expectations.   </p>

<p>I'll lead you on a brief tour of various error handling patterns and paradigms and their strengths and failings.  As a polyglot dabbler, I've done just enough with each of these languages to have formed cranky opinions.</p>

<p>By the end, we'll have new patterns to apply to our perl code (be in perl5 or perl6).</p>

<p>Compare and contrast:</p>

<ul>
<li>C inspired return values in C, perl5 and go</li>
<li>Java vs Python exceptions</li>
<li>Erlang: "let it crash" approach,  </li>
<li>Rust: Failure vs Panic </li>
<li>monadic:  Rust Option and Haskell Maybe.</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
<li>whatever it is that perl6 does ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of years ago I started down the rabbit hole that is OAuth2 and managed
to implement a plugin for Mojolicious. Since then I have abstracted
out a lot of the internals and now have a module to support all four OAuth2
flows, which is de-coupled from any specific web framework.</p>

<p>This talk will cover those four OAuth2 flows, with examples of using the module
and plugins to implement an OAuth2 authorization server in your framework of
choice.</p>

<p>Strong coffee is advised as a prerequisite to attending this talk.</p>


<p>I would call myself a software developer as this has been my primary role for over a decade. I am the maintainer / author of several modules on CPAN and a sporadic attendee / speaker at various conferences.</p>

<p>With Tau Station, we're building a sci-fi universe in a browser. However, in object oriented design, what does the "single responsibility principle" mean when your combat armor serves as armor, a weapon, and medkit?</p>

<p>And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit, or refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do you handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?</p>

<p>And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe drives almost everything?</p>

<p>This talk explores some of the techniques we've developed for the Tau Station to easily model complex behaviors.</p>

<p>Perl 6 has amazing built-in features for writing command-line utilities.  But sometimes even those aren't enough.  In this talk, we push it further to allow features such as subcommands, command-specific help and interleaved positional and named arguments.  We use metaprogramming to look up dispatch tables for multi-candidates, scrutinize signatures, and query POD declarator blocks.  We show how integration with command line argument parsing is a practical application of Perl 6's rich meta-object protocol.</p>

<p>After that we'll talk about how the DateTime suite of modules can make your life a little easier. I'll show you some best practices for working with dates and times, and highlight some gotchas in DateTime's API, and with datetimes in general.</p>


<p>Dave Rolsky has been a Perl developer since 1999, and has created or contributed to dozens of CPAN modules, including DateTime, Log::Dispatch, Params::Validate, and more.

<p>This talk will cover the basics of intellectual property law as it relates to software development, focusing on how it works (or doesn't) to facilitate code reuse through open source licensing. This session will explain the differences between patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and illustrate how those legal tools can be applied to a piece of software to achieve different business goals. It will also discuss common open source licenses, and explain the legal consequences those licenses have for software development and commercialization.</p>

<p>As someone who's both done a lot of hiring and been through many interviews, I can tell you with great certainty that it's almost uniformly terrible. I have some ideas on how you can make your hiring process less terrible, both for the candidates and for yourself.</p>

<p>Some topics I'll cover are how most processes suck, how to write a good job description, pre-interview screening approaches, how not to be a complete jerk when you interview someone, questions to ask (and question to not ask), and more.</p>

<p>The publicly visible part of the Perl 5 codebase consists of the Perl 5 core distribution and the totality of all the libraries on CPAN.  We assess the health of the codebase via testing:  smoke-testing of Perl 5 blead and CPANtesters testing of new CPAN releases on a wide variety of versions of Perl and of operating systems.</p>

<p>But what happens when the code is not so healthy or when we need to provide preventative care?  How well are our tools suited for that purpose?</p>

<p>In this presentation we'll discuss the current state of Perl 5 smoke testing, testing of CPAN libraries and the mysterious land between them known as "Blead Breaks CPAN."  We'll see some of the challenges which the Perl 5 Porters face in moving the core language forward without causing major problems for CPAN libraries and other users.  And we'll introduce some ideas for improvements in the ways we maintain the health of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Introducing a new GraphQL implementation for Perl 6.  GraphQL (graphql.org) was recently released by Facebook with an open source reference implementation in Javascript and a public specification, and has been widely ported since then.  This Perl 6 implementation capitalizes on some features of Perl 6, including grammars, introspection, concurrency, traits, etc. that make Perl 6 ideal for GraphQL, and make Perl 6 GraphQL great for implementing a web API for your data, regardless of your existing database technology.  This talk will introduce GraphQL briefly, and describe how to build a GraphQL schema and server in Perl 6.</p>

<p>Jason McIntosh spent much of 2016 creating BumpySkies (bumpyskies.com), a turbulence-forecasting tool for nervous air passengers (such as himself). In this talk, Jason explains why he spent a year writing a web application instead of writing a book, why making one dang webpage took a whole year (government agencies are involved), and the hopes and uncertainties that lie in the project's future (government agencies are involved).</p>

<p>Maybe he should have written a book after all. Well, whatever, he did this anyway, and he's going to talk about it. Come hear him talk about the rewards of asking people for stuff nicely, and the pitfalls of writing software that's only useful for doing a thing that you're normally too scared to do very much.</p>

<p>Look, he's already written two books and that's all behind him now, okay?</p>

<h2>The \X-Files: Characters for Humans</h2>

<p>A “character” can mean different things to different people, but the largest disparity is between applications and the humans who use them. Programmers aren’t to blame, as our programming languages, libraries, and databases provide little or no support for understanding user-perceived characters. Many systems disagree on the basic units of characters, some use code points, others use code units, and others still operate on individual bytes by default. This frequently leads to products with a poor experience in some users’ languages, especially written languages that use grapheme clusters, sequences of code points that compose a single user-perceived character. With the rise in global emoji usage and the rapid evolution of standard emoji sequences, this problem is increasingly experienced by users worldwide, regardless of their language.</p>

<p>This session will cover:
• Extended grapheme clusters and emoji sequences
• Programming with these user-perceived characters
• Data input, parsing, analysis, formatting, and output
• Setting product requirements for character support
• Examples from Shutterstock’s platforms for content editing and collaboration</p>

<h2>Lost art of troubleshooting</h2>

<p>There are a lot of great things about the cloud, but the "destroy and rebuild" philosophy which is really good for building a continuous delivery pipeline, really sucks when applied to troubleshooting production problems. When your application goes haywire, the most valuable engineering skill is not the the ability to bring up a copy of your system or even the knowledge of a your technology stack (although it doesn't hurt).  It is the skill of understanding and solving problems.</p>

<p>Finding the root cause of the issue and mitigating it with minimal disruption in production is a must-have skill for engineers responsible for managing and maintaining production systems. In this talk I will discuss the skills required to troubleshoot complex systems, traits that prevent engineers from being successful at troubleshooting and discuss some techniques and tips and trick for troubleshooting complex systems in production.</p>


<p>Leon's two decades of expertise were concentrated on architecting and operating complex, web-based systems to withstand crushing traffic (often unexpectedly). Over the years, he's had a somewhat unique opportunity to design and build systems that run some of the most visited websites in the world. While his core expertise is in Perl and application development in general, he works his way around the whole technology stack from system architecture to databases design and code optimization. He's considered a professional naysayer by peers and has the opinion that nothing really works until it works for at least a million people.</p>
