This is the website for The Perl Conference 2017 in Washington, DC.

## Aesthetic 'Alpha'

This is simply at attempt to turn an image in my head into CSS/HTML/SVG.  I'm not happy with it, but it may be a starting point from which to solicit iimproving opinions or directions.

## Notions

* Adding animate/parallax libraries might give it some pleasant motion on scroll
* It might play better when it has some photography to break up the monotony?
* It's okay, so far, for mobile
* The map is a screenshot from a leaflet style that seemed appropriate... we'd probably be better off just usting a leaflet directly, but I had some trouble getting the original iframe map to play with attempts to tuck it neatly into the figure frame.
